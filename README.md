Monitoring Plugin to check Apache2 Status

Modified check_apachestatus.pl, originally found on Nagios Exchange (https://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins/Web-Servers/Apache/check_apachestatus/details) with modifications from several contributers over the years. I was unable to find a maintained plugin in any public repository, hence created this for my own purpose.
